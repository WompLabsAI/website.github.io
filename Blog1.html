a new SOTA for predicting the downstream effects of dataset
changes!</h2>
<p>At Womp Labs, we spend all of our time thinking about the way ML
models use their training data. When a model fails, it would be great to
pinpoint the source of the problem. When you have many data sources,
youâ€™d like to know if only one of them was doing the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>The methods used to solve these problems fall under the umbrella of
data attribution. Fundamentally, this is a challenge of tracing model
outputs to training data, and then using this understanding to infer how
to change data to affect downstream behavior. Some background can be
found in <a
href="https://ml-data-tutorial.org/assets/DataTutorialICML2024.pdf">this
ICML tutorial</a>.</p>

(LDS)</h3>
<p>A core goal is to accurately predict the outcome of training on some
dataset without having to do so. To quantify how good a method is at
this, we can use the following:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[LDS(\tau,z):=\rho(f(z,\theta^*(D_j)):j\in[m],{g_\tau(z,D_j;D):j\in[m]})\tag{1}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the training set,
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the output of model <span
class="math inline">\(\theta^*\)</span>, trained on <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\subset D\)</span>, on example of interest
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is number of evaluation subsets, and
<span class="math inline">\(g_\tau\)</span> is the output prediction
made by attribution method <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. In
simpler terms, we are trying to answer the following question:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[How\ accurately\ can\ we\ predict\
which\ dataset\ is\ better\ for\ learning\ example\ z?\]</span></p>
<h3 id="trak">TRAK</h3>
<p>Just over a year ago, a lab at MIT introduced <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14186">TRAK</a>, a data attribution
method orders of magnitudes more efficient than the prior <em>state of
the art</em>. Their approach casts the complex problem of attributing
influence in neural nets to the well understood setting of linear
regression. Leaving the details to their paper, the final form of their
method is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_{TRAK}(z,S) :=
S(\frac{1}{M^2}(\sum_{m=1}^M
Q_m)(\sum_{m=1}^M\phi(z)(\phi^T\phi)^{-1}\phi^T),\hat\lambda)\tag{2}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is an example of
interest, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the number of
reference models used, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is a
random projection of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_\theta
f(z)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is the stacked
matrix of <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span> for all training
examples <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the diagonal matrix of <span
class="math inline">\(1-p_i\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a soft threshold function with
threshold <span class="math inline">\(\hat\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="random-projections-and-the-jl-lemma">Random Projections and the
JL Lemma</h3>
<p>One of the understood sources of error in the TRAK formulation is the
random projection step. However, a theoretical result from <a
href="https://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/JL-Johnson.pdf">Johnson
and Lindenstrauss</a>, which shows inner products are preserved with
high probability when projecting via a matrix <span
class="math inline">\(P\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)^{p\times{k}}\)</span>, leads
to the belief that this error is small. As a result, the ensembling
improvement from <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> different models
is attributed to the need for different training trajectories to sample
different possible loss landscapes.</p>
<p>We show that this is not entirely the case. In fact, a large portion
of the error comes from imperfections in the projection step.</p>
<h3 id="projection-dimension-and-the-h-1-approximation">Projection
Dimension and the <span class="math inline">\(H^{-1}\)</span>
Approximation</h3>
<p>To reduce this degradation in accuracy, one can increase the
projection dimension. But, the TRAK paper shows that there is an optimal
projection dimension, beyond which performance starts to degrade. While
we expect higher resolution representations to be less lossy, the issue
comes from the inverse Hessian approximation <span
class="math inline">\((\Phi_m^T\Phi_m)^{-1}\)</span>. As dimensionality
increases, the number of spurious correlations grows. But, a small tweak
to the setup fixes this problem.</p>
<h2
id="trak-with-optimally-modified-projections-womp-_haha-see-what-we-did-there">TRAK
With Optimally Modified Projections (WOMP)<span class="math inline">\(\
_{haha,\ see\ what\ we\ did\ there}\)</span></h2>
<p>We modify TRAK by decomposing the projected gradients into blocks. In
doing so, we produce what resembles multiple checkpoints from a single
backward pass. For example, one checkpoint projected to <span
class="math inline">\(d=4096\)</span> can also be treated as <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> different <span
class="math inline">\(d_{batch}=1024\)</span> checkpoints. The result is
the following formulation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_{TRAK_{WOMP}}(z,S) :=
S(\frac{1}{M^2}(\sum_{m=1}^M
Q_m)*(\sum_{m=1}^M\sum_{b=1}^B\phi_{m,b}(z)(\Phi_{m,b}^T\Phi_{m,b})^{-1}\Phi_{m,b}^T),\hat\lambda)\tag{3}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the number of blocks
we decompose the projection into and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_{m,b}(z) = \phi_m(z)^{(b)}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="an-equivalent-definition">An Equivalent Definition</h3>
<p>An alternative way to frame our setup is as a block-wise
decomposition of the <span class="math inline">\(H^{-1}\)</span>
approximation. We redefine the Hessian approximation term as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_m^{-1} =
diag(\Phi_{m,1}^T\Phi_{m,1},\Phi_{m,2}^T\Phi_{m,2},...,\Phi_{m,B}^T\Phi_{m,B})^{-1}\tag{4}\]</span></p>
<p>We then, equivalent to <span class="math inline">\((3)\)</span>, come
to the definition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_{TRAK_{WOMP}}(z,S) :=
S(\frac{1}{M^2}(\sum_{m=1}^M
Q_m)*(\sum_{m=1}^M\phi_{m}(z){\hat{H}_m}^{-1}\Phi_{m}^T),\hat\lambda)\tag{5}\]</span></p>
<p>Our simple change allows us to increase the projection dimension,
thereby achieving higher resolution representations, without sacrificing
the accuracy of the hessian approximation. What is nice about this setup
is it introduces no additional backward passes per reference model.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Our goal is to accurately predict the result of training a <span
class="math inline">\(Resnet-9\)</span> on a given subset of <span
class="math inline">\(CIFAR10\)</span> without having to train the
model. To make these predictions we train <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> models on random <span
class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> subsets of the dataset. We use
checkpoints from these models to compute attribution scores. We then
evaluate the methods with <span class="math inline">\(LDS\)</span> using
<span class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span> models.</p>

<p><em>Figure 2: We evaluate the most common real-world scenario: <span
class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> reference model. <span
class="math inline">\(TRAK_{WOMP}\)</span> results in predictions that
are over <span class="math inline">\(2.5\ times\)</span> more accurate

<p>In most settings it is not feasible to retrain multiple models. As a
result, the most important measure of effectiveness is the case of <span
class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span>. We show that <span
class="math inline">\(TRAK_{WOMP}\)</span> drastically outperforms
vanilla <span class="math inline">\(TRAK\)</span>.</p>

<p><em>Figure 3: We illustrate the utility of increasing the number of
blocks when the projection dimension is fixed. In this case, we use
<span class="math inline">\(d = 32768\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>So far, we have shown results when per-block projection dimension was
fixed. However, we know this requires <span class="math inline">\(B\
times\)</span> more storage. In some cases there can be storage
constraints as well. In <em>Figure 3</em>, we fix the total projection
dimension, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and vary <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Out results show that, not only is
<span class="math inline">\(TRAK_{WOMP}\)</span> superior on a fixed
compute budget, it is better on a fixed storage budget as well.</p>
<h2 id="more-to-come">More To Come â€¦</h2>
<p>We know these results are on a small scale model, but we have more to
share soon on billion(s) parameter models and internet scale datasets.
We believe there doesnâ€™t need to be <em>hope</em> and <em>guesswork</em>
when training large models. If you agree and are interested in
